1.ONLY SINGLE NUMBER IN AN ARRAY 

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

.ROMAN TO INTEGER

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

question13 = `
You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:

"1" -> 'A'
"2" -> 'B'
...
"25" -> 'Y'
"26" -> 'Z'

However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).
Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2

Explanation:
"12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3

Explanation:
"226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

Example 3:
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0

Explanation:
"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.
Give test cases for this`;

question14 = `
robber is targeting to rob houses from a street. Each house has security measures that alert the police when two adjacent houses are robbed. The houses are arranged in a circular manner, thus the first and last houses are adjacent to each other.

Given an integer array money, where money[i] represents the amount of money that can be looted from the (i+1)th house. Return the maximum amount of money that the robber can loot without alerting the police.

Example 1
Input: money = [2, 1, 4, 9]
Output: 10

Explanation:
[2, 1, 4, 9] The underlined houses would give the maximum loot.

Note that we cannot loot the 1st and 4th houses together.`;

question15 = `Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: n = 3
Output: false`;
